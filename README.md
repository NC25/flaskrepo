This repository is for the FullStack Sports Aptitude Project for Sports Analytics at Berkeley. In this FullStack application, we use Python and Flask to provide a seamless UI and visualization dashboard. This dashboard allows users to search and filter players. More importantly, this dashboard provides complex features, like graphics of players tendencies and statistics for ALL players who registered minutes during the season.
